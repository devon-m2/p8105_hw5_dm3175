# Problem 1

## Load and Clean Data

First, the data from the longitudinal study was loaded and cleaned. The files were originally stored in separate csv files, but were loaded and combined into one dateframe using the `map` function. The `map` function iterates over the cells in the file name column and enters them into a new column in the data frame.  

```{r}
longit_file_names = tibble(files = list.files("./data"),
                           path = str_c("./data/", files)) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() 

longit_tidy = longit_file_names %>% 
  mutate(patient_data = map(path, read_csv)) %>% 
  unnest() %>% 
  gather(key = week, value = obs, week_1:week_8)


```

Load and Clean Data
-------------------

First, the data from the longitudinal study was loaded and cleaned. The files were originally stored in separate csv files, but were loaded and combined into one dateframe using the `map` function. The `map` function iterates over the cells in the file name column and enters them into a new column in the data frame.

``` r
longit_file_names = tibble(files = list.files("./data"),
                           path = str_c("./data/", files)) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() 

longit_tidy = longit_file_names %>% 
  mutate(patient_data = map(path, read_csv)) %>% 
  unnest() %>% 
  gather(key = week, value = obs, week_1:week_8)
```
